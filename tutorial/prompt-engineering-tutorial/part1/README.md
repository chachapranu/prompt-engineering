# Part 1: Core Foundations (60 minutes)

**Learning Objective:** Understand what prompt engineering actually is at its core

This foundational part establishes the essential understanding needed for everything that follows. You'll learn how LLMs actually process prompts, why certain approaches work, and the fundamental principles that make prompt engineering effective.

## Sections

### [1.1 How LLMs Actually Work](01-how-llms-work.md) (20 minutes)
- Essential concept: LLMs predict next tokens based on probability distributions
- How prompts shift these probability distributions toward desired outputs
- Context windows and why they matter for prompt design

### [1.2 The Prompt-Response Loop](02-prompt-response-loop.md) (20 minutes)  
- Prompts as instructions that access pre-trained knowledge
- Why specificity matters: concrete examples showing vague vs. precise prompts
- Pattern completion: how LLMs learn to finish what you start
- **Key Insight:** Prompts are communication protocols, not just questions

### [1.3 First Principles of Effective Prompting](03-first-principles.md) (20 minutes)
- Clarity: Be explicit about what you want
- Context: Provide relevant background information  
- Structure: Organize information logically
- Examples: Show rather than just tell
- **Practical Exercise:** Transform 3 poor prompts into effective ones

## Key Takeaways

By the end of Part 1, you should understand:

1. **Mechanistic Understanding**: How LLMs process and respond to prompts at a fundamental level
2. **Communication Framework**: How to think about prompts as structured communication
3. **Core Principles**: The foundational rules that make prompts effective
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Why certain prompt structures consistently work better

## Prerequisites for This Section

- Basic familiarity with AI/ML concepts
- Understanding that LLMs are trained on text prediction tasks
- No coding experience required for Part 1

## Next Steps

After completing Part 1, you'll be ready for [Part 2: Essential Prompt Techniques](../part2/README.md), where you'll learn the specific techniques that apply these principles in practice.
