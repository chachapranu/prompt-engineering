# Part 3: Building AI Agents with Prompts (100 minutes)

**Learning Objective:** Understand how prompt engineering enables AI agents and tools

This part bridges the gap between individual prompting techniques and sophisticated AI systems. You'll learn how agents are essentially sophisticated prompt orchestration systems and how to design workflows that combine multiple prompts to achieve complex objectives.

## Sections

### [3.1 Agent Fundamentals](01-agent-fundamentals.md) (30 minutes)
- System prompts vs. user prompts: defining agent behavior
- Tool calling and function integration through prompts
- State management across interactions
- **Key Insight:** Agents are sophisticated prompt orchestration systems

### [3.2 Workflow Design](02-workflow-design.md) (45 minutes)
- Breaking complex tasks into prompt-manageable components
- Sequential vs. parallel prompt execution
- Error handling and recovery strategies
- **Case Study:** Building a research agent step-by-step

### [3.3 Agent Communication Patterns](03-agent-communication.md) (25 minutes)
- Agent-to-agent communication protocols
- Multi-agent coordination through prompts
- Handoff patterns and state transfer
- **Practical Examples:** Customer service, code generation, content creation agents

## What You'll Learn

By the end of Part 3, you'll understand:

1. **Agent Architecture**: How prompts define agent behavior and capabilities
2. **Workflow Orchestration**: Breaking complex tasks into manageable prompt sequences
3. **State Management**: Maintaining context and data across multiple interactions
4. **Tool Integration**: Using prompts to coordinate between AI and external systems
5. **Communication Patterns**: How agents interact with each other and users
6. **Error Handling**: Building robust agents that recover from failures gracefully

## Prerequisites

- Completion of [Part 1: Core Foundations](../part1/README.md) and [Part 2: Essential Techniques](../part2/README.md)
- Understanding of the Big 5 prompt techniques
- Familiarity with context management concepts

## Practical Focus

This section emphasizes hands-on understanding:
- **Step-by-step agent construction** from basic to sophisticated
- **Real workflow examples** from research, customer service, and content creation
- **Debugging strategies** for when agent workflows fail
- **Architecture patterns** you can adapt to different use cases

## Key Concepts Introduced

**System vs User Prompts**: How different prompt types serve different functions in agent architecture

**Prompt Orchestration**: Coordinating multiple prompts to achieve complex objectives

**State Management**: Maintaining information flow across multi-step processes

**Tool Calling**: Using prompts to bridge AI capabilities with external functions and APIs

**Agent Communication**: How multiple agents coordinate through structured prompt protocols

## Next Steps

After mastering agent construction in Part 3, you'll move to [Part 4: Advanced Applications](../part4/README.md) to learn domain-specific applications and production considerations for deploying these systems effectively.
