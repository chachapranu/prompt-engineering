# 3.1 Agent Fundamentals (30 minutes)

## Core Concept

AI agents are sophisticated prompt orchestration systems that combine system-level instructions, user interactions, tool integrations, and state management to accomplish complex, multi-step tasks autonomously.

**Key Insight:** Every AI agent, from simple chatbots to complex autonomous systems, is fundamentally built on carefully designed prompts that define behavior, capabilities, and decision-making processes.

## System Prompts vs. User Prompts

### Understanding the Distinction

**System Prompts** define the agent's core behavior, personality, and capabilities. They're typically hidden from users and remain constant across interactions.

**User Prompts** are the specific requests or inputs that users provide to interact with the agent.

### System Prompt Architecture

**The Core Identity Layer:**
```
You are a professional research assistant specializing in business analysis. You have access to web search, document analysis, and data visualization tools. Your role is to help users gather, analyze, and present business intelligence.

Core behaviors:
- Always verify information from multiple sources
- Present findings in structured, actionable formats
- Ask clarifying questions when requests are ambiguous
- Maintain professional, consultative tone
- Prioritize accuracy over speed
```

**The Capability Layer:**
```
Available tools and when to use them:
- web_search(): For current information and data
- analyze_document(): For processing uploaded files
- create_visualization(): For charts and graphs
- calculate(): For numerical analysis

Decision framework:
1. Understand the research question
2. Identify required information sources
3. Gather and verify data
4. Analyze patterns and insights
5. Present findings with recommendations
```

**The Interaction Layer:**
```
Communication style:
- Begin with understanding: "Let me clarify what you're looking for..."
- Show your process: "I'll search for X, then analyze Y..."
- Present structured results: Use headers, bullets, and clear sections
- End with next steps: "Based on this analysis, I recommend..."

When uncertain:
- Ask specific clarifying questions
- Explain what additional information would improve the analysis
- Offer alternative research approaches
```

### System Prompt Best Practices

**‚úÖ Be Specific About Behavior:**
```
When users ask vague questions, respond with: "To provide the most helpful analysis, I need to understand: [specific clarifying questions]. This will help me focus my research on what matters most to your decision."
```

**‚úÖ Define Clear Boundaries:**
```
I cannot:
- Access real-time stock prices or provide investment advice
- Guarantee accuracy of third-party data sources
- Make decisions for you, only provide analysis to inform decisions

I excel at:
- Gathering comprehensive information from multiple sources
- Identifying patterns and trends in data
- Presenting complex information in digestible formats
```

**‚úÖ Establish Quality Standards:**
```
Quality criteria for my responses:
- Cite at least 2 independent sources for factual claims
- Include confidence levels: "High confidence" vs "Preliminary finding"
- Acknowledge limitations and uncertainties
- Provide specific, actionable recommendations
```

## Tool Calling and Function Integration

### The Prompt-to-Function Bridge

Tools and functions are integrated through carefully designed prompts that specify when and how to use them.

**Tool Decision Pattern:**
```
Based on the user's request, determine which tools to use:

Request analysis:
- Information needed: [What data/insights are required]
- Current knowledge gaps: [What I don't know]
- Best information sources: [Where to find reliable data]

Tool selection:
IF request requires current/real-time data ‚Üí use web_search()
IF request involves uploaded document ‚Üí use analyze_document()  
IF request needs numerical analysis ‚Üí use calculate()
IF results would benefit from visualization ‚Üí use create_visualization()

For each selected tool:
1. Prepare specific, targeted queries
2. Execute tool with appropriate parameters
3. Validate and cross-reference results
4. Integrate findings into comprehensive response
```

### Example: Research Agent Tool Integration

**User Request:** "Analyze the competitive landscape for project management software"

**Agent's Internal Processing:**
```
Request analysis:
- Information needed: Market competitors, features, pricing, market share
- Current knowledge gaps: Recent market changes, new entrants, current pricing
- Best sources: Company websites, industry reports, user reviews

Selected tools:
1. web_search("project management software market leaders 2024")
2. web_search("project management software pricing comparison")
3. web_search("project management software user reviews analysis")
4. create_visualization(comparison_data)

Execution plan:
1. Search for market overview and key players
2. Gather detailed feature and pricing information
3. Collect user satisfaction data
4. Synthesize findings into competitive analysis
5. Create visual comparison chart
6. Provide strategic recommendations
```

### Tool Calling Prompt Patterns

**Sequential Tool Pattern:**
```
Step 1: Use web_search() to gather initial data
Step 2: Use analyze_document() to process findings
Step 3: Use calculate() to derive insights
Step 4: Use create_visualization() to present results
```

**Conditional Tool Pattern:**
```
IF user uploads document:
    Use analyze_document() first, then supplement with web_search()
ELSE IF user asks for current data:
    Use web_search() primarily
ELSE IF user provides data to analyze:
    Use calculate() and create_visualization()
```

**Parallel Tool Pattern:**
```
Simultaneously:
- web_search(topic A)
- web_search(topic B) 
- web_search(topic C)

Then synthesize all results into comprehensive analysis
```

## State Management Across Interactions

### The Challenge of Stateful Conversations

AI agents need to maintain context, remember decisions, and build on previous interactions while staying within context window limitations.

### State Management Strategies

**Session State Tracking:**
```
Current session context:
- Research topic: [Main subject being investigated]
- Key findings so far: [Bullet points of discoveries]
- User preferences: [Format preferences, priorities, constraints]
- Next logical steps: [What should happen next]
- Open questions: [Unresolved issues that need follow-up]

Update this context after each interaction.
```

**Decision State Pattern:**
```
Decisions made in this session:
1. Focus area: [Specific scope defined]
2. Information sources: [Which sources were deemed most relevant]
3. Analysis framework: [How we're approaching the problem]
4. Presentation format: [How user wants results delivered]

Reference these decisions to maintain consistency across multiple exchanges.
```

**Progress State Tracking:**
```
Research progress:
‚úì Completed: [What has been thoroughly investigated]
‚è≥ In progress: [Current areas of investigation]  
üîÑ Needs revision: [Areas requiring updates or corrections]
‚ùì Outstanding: [Questions or areas still to investigate]

Use this to guide next steps and avoid repetition.
```

### Example: Multi-Turn Research Session

**Turn 1:**
```
User: "I need to research the electric vehicle market"
Agent: [Establishes scope, begins research, updates state]

Session state after Turn 1:
- Topic: Electric vehicle market analysis
- Scope: Not yet defined (global vs regional, consumer vs commercial)
- Findings: Preliminary market overview gathered
- Next: Need to clarify scope and focus areas
```

**Turn 2:**
```
User: "Focus on the US consumer market, particularly Tesla's competition"
Agent: [Narrows research focus, updates state]

Session state after Turn 2:
- Topic: US consumer EV market, Tesla competitive analysis
- Scope: US consumer market, competition focus
- Findings: Tesla market position, key competitors identified
- Next: Deep dive into competitive advantages/disadvantages
```

**Turn 3:**
```
User: "What are Tesla's main vulnerabilities?"
Agent: [Leverages previous research, focuses on vulnerabilities]

Session state after Turn 3:
- Topic: Tesla competitive vulnerabilities in US consumer EV market
- Key vulnerabilities: [List discovered weaknesses]
- Supporting evidence: [Data backing up vulnerability claims]
- Next: User might want mitigation strategies or competitive responses
```

## Agent Architecture Patterns

### The Layered Agent Pattern

**Layer 1: Identity and Purpose**
```
Core identity: What the agent is and its primary function
Mission statement: What it aims to accomplish
Value proposition: How it helps users
```

**Layer 2: Capabilities and Tools**
```
Available functions: What the agent can do
Tool integration: How it accesses external capabilities
Limitation awareness: What it cannot do
```

**Layer 3: Interaction Management**
```
Communication style: How it talks to users
Process transparency: How it explains its work
Error handling: How it responds to problems
```

**Layer 4: Quality Assurance**
```
Verification standards: How it ensures accuracy
Confidence reporting: How it communicates certainty levels
Improvement feedback: How it learns from interactions
```
