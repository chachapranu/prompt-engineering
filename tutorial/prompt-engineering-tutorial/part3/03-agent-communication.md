# 3.3 Agent Communication Patterns (25 minutes)

## Core Concept

Agent communication patterns define how multiple AI agents coordinate, share information, and collaborate to accomplish tasks that require diverse expertise or parallel processing. Effective communication protocols enable sophisticated multi-agent workflows while maintaining clarity and error recovery.

**Key Insight:** Multi-agent systems are most effective when agents have clear communication protocols, defined roles, and explicit handoff procedures—just like human teams.

## Agent-to-Agent Communication Protocols

### The Communication Stack

**Layer 1: Message Format Standards**
All agent communications follow consistent structures for predictable parsing and response.

**Layer 2: Role and Responsibility Definitions**
Each agent has clearly defined capabilities and decision-making authority.

**Layer 3: Handoff and Coordination Protocols**
Explicit procedures for transferring work and maintaining state across agents.

**Layer 4: Error Handling and Recovery**
Procedures for handling communication failures and agent errors.

### Standard Message Format

**Agent Communication Template:**
```
FROM: [Agent Name/Role]
TO: [Target Agent Name/Role]
TYPE: [REQUEST | RESPONSE | UPDATE | ERROR]
CONTEXT: [Reference to shared state/task]

MESSAGE:
[Specific content following role-appropriate format]

EXPECTED_RESPONSE: [What type of response is needed]
DEADLINE: [If time-sensitive]
DEPENDENCIES: [What must be completed before response]
```

### Example: Research-to-Analysis Handoff

**Research Agent to Analysis Agent:**
```
FROM: Research_Agent
TO: Analysis_Agent
TYPE: REQUEST
CONTEXT: Market_Analysis_Task_001

MESSAGE:
Research phase complete for EV charging infrastructure market analysis.

Deliverables ready:
- Market size data (2020-2024) with growth projections
- Competitive landscape with 15 key players profiled
- Regulatory environment analysis across 5 regions
- Technology trend assessment with adoption timelines

Data quality notes:
- High confidence: Market size, major player data
- Medium confidence: Growth projections, regulatory timeline
- Gaps identified: Rural deployment strategies, grid impact analysis

EXPECTED_RESPONSE: Strategic analysis with investment recommendations
DEADLINE: 60 minutes from now
DEPENDENCIES: None - all research inputs ready
```

**Analysis Agent Response:**
```
FROM: Analysis_Agent
TO: Research_Agent
TYPE: RESPONSE
CONTEXT: Market_Analysis_Task_001

MESSAGE:
Research deliverables received and validated. Beginning strategic analysis.

Processing plan:
1. Market opportunity sizing (15 min)
2. Competitive advantage analysis (20 min)  
3. Investment risk assessment (15 min)
4. Strategic recommendations (10 min)

Clarification needed:
- Target audience for recommendations (investors vs. market participants vs. policy makers)?
- Investment timeframe focus (1-year vs. 5-year opportunities)?

## Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns

### Pattern 1: Sequential Handoff Chain

**Use Case:** Complex tasks requiring specialized expertise at each stage

**Structure:**
```
Agent A (Specialist 1) → Agent B (Specialist 2) → Agent C (Specialist 3) → Final Output
```

**Example: Content Creation Pipeline**
```
Research_Agent → Writing_Agent → SEO_Agent → Review_Agent → Published Content
```

**Coordination Protocol:**
```
Each agent in chain:
1. Receives validated input from previous agent
2. Performs specialized processing
3. Validates output quality before handoff
4. Provides context and guidance to next agent
5. Remains available for clarification requests
```

### Pattern 2: Hub-and-Spoke Coordination

**Use Case:** Central coordinator managing multiple specialist agents

**Structure:**
```
        Specialist A
            ↙
Coordinator ← → Specialist B
            ↘
        Specialist C
```

**Example: Business Analysis Hub**
```
            Market_Research_Agent
                    ↙
Analysis_Coordinator ← → Financial_Analysis_Agent
                    ↘
            Competitive_Intelligence_Agent
```

**Coordination Protocol:**
```
Coordinator responsibilities:
- Task decomposition and assignment
- Progress monitoring and synchronization
- Quality assurance across specialist outputs
- Integration and synthesis of results
- Client communication and requirements management

Specialist responsibilities:
- Execute assigned specialized tasks
- Communicate progress and issues to coordinator
- Provide expertise for cross-domain questions
- Validate inputs from other specialists when needed
```

### Pattern 3: Peer-to-Peer Collaboration

**Use Case:** Agents with complementary skills working together iteratively

**Structure:**
```
Agent A ← → Agent B
    ↕       ↕
Agent C ← → Agent D
```

**Example: Product Development Team**
```
UX_Agent ← → Technical_Agent
    ↕           ↕
Market_Agent ← → Strategy_Agent
```

**Coordination Protocol:**
```
Collaboration rules:
- Any agent can initiate communication with any other agent
- All communications copied to shared context/memory
- Decision authority clearly defined for different domains
- Conflict resolution procedures established
- Regular synchronization checkpoints scheduled
```

## Handoff Patterns and State Transfer

### State Transfer Mechanisms

**Complete State Transfer:**
```
HANDOFF_PACKAGE:
- Task context and objectives
- All relevant data and findings
- Work completed and quality validated
- Outstanding questions or concerns
- Recommended next steps
- Quality assurance checklist completed
```

**Incremental State Updates:**
```
PROGRESS_UPDATE:
- Work completed since last update
- New findings or insights
- Changes to timeline or approach
- Issues requiring coordination
- Next milestone and timeline
```

**Context-Only Transfer:**
```
CONTEXT_HANDOFF:
- Task overview and current status
- Key decisions made
- Quality standards and constraints
- Where to find detailed work products
- Contact info for clarification
```

### Example: Customer Service Escalation

**Tier 1 to Tier 2 Handoff:**
```
FROM: Tier1_Support_Agent
TO: Tier2_Technical_Agent
TYPE: ESCALATION
CONTEXT: Ticket_12345_API_Integration_Issue

HANDOFF_PACKAGE:
