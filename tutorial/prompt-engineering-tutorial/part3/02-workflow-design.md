# 3.2 Workflow Design (45 minutes)

## Core Concept

Workflow design is the art of breaking complex, multi-step tasks into sequences of manageable prompts that can be executed reliably by AI agents. Effective workflows balance task decomposition, error handling, and resource management to achieve sophisticated objectives.

**Key Insight:** Complex tasks that would overwhelm a single prompt become manageable when broken into well-designed workflow steps, each optimized for specific subtasks.

## Breaking Complex Tasks into Prompt-Manageable Components

### The Task Decomposition Process

**Step 1: Understand the Complete Objective**
- What is the final deliverable?
- Who is the end user and what do they need?
- What are the success criteria?

**Step 2: Identify Required Information and Capabilities**
- What information needs to be gathered?
- What analysis or processing must be performed?
- What external tools or resources are needed?

**Step 3: Map Dependencies and Sequence**
- Which tasks must happen before others?
- What information flows between steps?
- Where are the decision points?

**Step 4: Design Individual Prompts**
- Each step should have a clear, single responsibility
- Inputs and outputs should be well-defined
- Error handling should be built into each step

### Example: Research Report Workflow

**Complex Task:** "Create a comprehensive market analysis report for electric vehicle charging infrastructure"

**❌ Monolithic Approach (Likely to Fail):**
```
Create a comprehensive market analysis report for electric vehicle charging infrastructure including market size, key players, growth projections, regulatory landscape, technology trends, investment opportunities, and strategic recommendations.
```

**✅ Workflow Decomposition:**

**Step 1: Scope Definition**
```
Define the scope for an EV charging infrastructure market analysis:
- Geographic focus (global, regional, country-specific)
- Market segments (residential, commercial, fast-charging, etc.)
- Time horizon for analysis and projections
- Key questions the analysis should answer
- Target audience and use case for the report

Output: Structured scope document with clear parameters
```

**Step 2: Information Gathering**
```
Research EV charging infrastructure market data within the defined scope:
- Current market size and growth rates
- Key market players and their market positions
- Technology categories and adoption trends
- Regulatory environment and policy impacts
- Investment flows and funding patterns

Use web_search() to gather current data from industry reports, company filings, and market research.
Output: Organized research findings with source citations
```

**Step 3: Competitive Analysis**
```
Analyze the competitive landscape using the gathered data:
- Market share analysis of key players
- Competitive positioning and differentiation strategies
- Strengths and weaknesses of major competitors
- Emerging players and disruptive technologies
- Partnership and acquisition patterns

Output: Competitive landscape summary with strategic insights
```

**Step 4: Trend Analysis**
```
Identify and analyze key trends affecting the market:
- Technology evolution (charging speeds, standards, interoperability)
- Policy and regulatory developments
- Consumer behavior and adoption patterns
- Infrastructure deployment strategies
- Economic factors and cost trends

Output: Trend analysis with implications for market development
```

**Step 5: Synthesis and Strategic Insights**
```
Synthesize research findings into strategic insights:
- Market growth projections and key drivers
- Investment opportunities and risk factors
- Strategic recommendations for different stakeholder types
- Critical success factors for market participants
- Potential market scenarios and their implications

Output: Strategic analysis with actionable insights
```

**Step 6: Report Compilation**
```
Compile findings into a professional market analysis report:
- Executive summary (2 pages)
- Market overview and size analysis
- Competitive landscape analysis
- Trend analysis and future outlook
- Strategic recommendations
- Supporting data and methodology appendix

Format: Professional business report with charts and visual elements
Output: Complete market analysis report ready for stakeholder review
```

## Sequential vs. Parallel Prompt Execution

### Sequential Execution Patterns

**Linear Sequential (Most Common):**
```
Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3 → Step 4 → Final Output
```

**Use When:**
- Each step depends on the previous step's output
- Information builds progressively
- Single agent can handle all steps

**Conditional Sequential:**
```
Step 1 → Decision Point → Step 2A OR Step 2B → Step 3 → Final Output
```

**Use When:**
- Workflow branches based on intermediate results
- Different approaches needed for different scenarios
- Decision logic can be clearly defined

### Parallel Execution Patterns

**Independent Parallel:**
```
Step 1A ↘
Step 1B → Synthesis → Final Output
Step 1C ↗
```

**Use When:**
- Multiple independent research streams
- Different types of analysis on same topic
- Time constraints require faster execution

**Hierarchical Parallel:**
```
Main Task
├── Subtask A1 → Subtask A2
├── Subtask B1 → Subtask B2
└── Subtask C1 → Subtask C2
    ↓
Final Synthesis
```

**Use When:**
- Complex task has multiple distinct components
- Different expertise areas can work independently
- Results need integration at the end

### Example: Content Creation Workflow

**Sequential Approach:**
```
1. Topic Research → 2. Outline Creation → 3. Content Writing → 4. SEO Optimization → 5. Final Review
```

**Parallel Approach:**
```
1. Topic Research
   ├── 2A. Competitor Analysis (parallel)
   ├── 2B. Audience Research (parallel)
   └── 2C. Keyword Research (parallel)
3. Synthesis → 4. Content Creation → 5. Final Review
```

**When to Choose Each:**
- **Sequential:** When audience insights inform competitor analysis, which informs keyword strategy
- **Parallel:** When all three research areas can be investigated independently and synthesized later

## Error Handling and Recovery Strategies

### The Error-Prone Workflow Problem

Long workflows are vulnerable to failures at any step. A single failed step can invalidate hours of previous work.

### Defensive Workflow Design

**Step-Level Error Handling:**
```
For each workflow step:
1. Define expected inputs and validate them
2. Execute the main task with error detection
3. Validate outputs before passing to next step
4. If errors occur, attempt recovery or escalation
5. Log progress for debugging and recovery
```

**Example: Research Step with Error Handling**
```
## Step 2: Market Data Collection

Input validation:
- Scope parameters defined? [Check from Step 1]
- Geographic focus clear? [Validate specific regions/countries]
- Time horizon specified? [Confirm analysis period]

Task execution:
- Use web_search() to gather market data
- Cross-reference from multiple sources
- Verify data currency (published within last 12 months)

Output validation:
- Market size data found and quantified?
- Growth rates available from credible sources?
- Key players identified with market positions?

Error handling:
- If insufficient data found: Try alternative search terms and sources
- If conflicting data found: Flag conflicts and gather additional sources
- If critical data missing: Document gaps and adjust analysis approach

Recovery options:
- Retry with modified search strategy
- Escalate to human researcher for specialized sources
- Adjust scope to available data and document limitations
```

### Workflow-Level Error Recovery

**Checkpoint Pattern:**
```
Major Checkpoint 1: Information Gathering Complete
- All required data collected and validated
- Quality standards met for each data category
- Gaps identified and documented
- Decision: Proceed to analysis OR gather additional data

Major Checkpoint 2: Analysis Complete
- Key insights generated from data
- Analysis validated for logical consistency
- Competitive landscape clearly mapped
- Decision: Proceed to synthesis OR refine analysis

Major Checkpoint 3: Draft Report Complete
- All sections written and integrated
- Quality standards met for content and format
- Stakeholder requirements addressed
- Decision: Finalize report OR revise specific sections
```

**Rollback and Recovery:**
```
If workflow fails at any point:
1. Identify the failure point and root cause
2. Determine if issue is recoverable within current step
3. If not recoverable, roll back to last successful checkpoint
4. Modify approach based on failure analysis
5. Resume workflow with adjusted parameters
```
