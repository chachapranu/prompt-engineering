# Part 2: Essential Prompt Techniques (90 minutes)

**Learning Objective:** Master the core techniques that matter most in prompt engineering

Building on the foundational understanding from Part 1, this section teaches you the five most important prompt engineering techniques that consistently produce high-quality results. These techniques are your practical toolkit for solving real-world prompting challenges.

## Sections

### [2.1 The Big 5 Techniques](01-big-5-techniques.md) (45 minutes)
Master the core techniques that solve 80% of prompting challenges:

1. **Few-Shot Prompting:** Show examples to establish patterns (10 min)
2. **Chain-of-Thought:** Step-by-step reasoning prompts (10 min)  
3. **Role Prompting:** "Act as an expert..." and why it works (10 min)
4. **Template Structures:** Consistent formats for reliable outputs (10 min)
5. **Constraint Setting:** Explicit limitations and requirements (5 min)

Each technique includes: Why it works + 2-3 concrete examples + common mistakes

### [2.2 Context Management](02-context-management.md) (25 minutes)
- Working within context window limits
- Information hierarchy: what to include first
- Context compression techniques
- **Practical Focus:** Real examples of managing long conversations

### [2.3 Error Prevention and Recovery](03-error-prevention.md) (20 minutes)
- Common failure modes and how to avoid them
- Self-correction prompts
- Validation and verification techniques
- **Focus:** Prevention over extensive categorization

## Key Skills You'll Develop

By the end of Part 2, you'll be able to:

1. **Select the right technique** for different types of tasks
2. **Combine techniques** effectively for complex challenges
3. **Manage context efficiently** within token limits
4. **Prevent common failures** before they happen
5. **Debug and fix** problematic prompts systematically

## Prerequisites

- Completion of [Part 1: Core Foundations](../part1/README.md)
- Understanding of how LLMs process prompts
- Familiarity with the four principles (Clarity, Context, Structure, Examples)

## What You'll Practice

Each technique section includes:
- **Hands-on examples** you can try immediately
- **Before/after comparisons** showing technique impact
- **Common mistakes** and how to avoid them
- **Quick exercises** to reinforce learning

## Next Steps

After mastering these essential techniques in Part 2, you'll be ready for [Part 3: Building AI Agents with Prompts](../part3/README.md), where you'll learn to orchestrate these techniques in complex, multi-step AI systems.
