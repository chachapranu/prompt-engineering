# 2.3 Error Prevention and Recovery (20 minutes)

## Core Concept

Most prompt engineering failures are predictable and preventable. Understanding common failure patterns allows you to design prompts that avoid problems before they occur and recover gracefully when unexpected issues arise.

**Key Insight:** Prevention is more efficient than correction—build robust prompts that fail gracefully rather than trying to fix problems after they happen.

## Common Failure Modes and Prevention

### 1. Ambiguity Failures

**Problem:** Vague prompts lead to responses that miss the mark

**❌ Failure-Prone:**
```
Make this better.
```

**❌ What Goes Wrong:**
- Model guesses what "better" means
- No clear success criteria
- Impossible to evaluate results

**✅ Prevention Strategy:**
```
Improve this email's clarity and professionalism:
- Remove casual language
- Make the request more specific
- Add a clear call-to-action
- Keep under 150 words

Original email: [content]
Success criteria: Recipient should know exactly what action to take
```

### 2. Context Confusion

**Problem:** Mixed signals or contradictory instructions confuse the model

**❌ Failure-Prone:**
```
Write a formal business proposal that's also casual and friendly. Make it detailed but keep it brief. Target technical and non-technical audiences.
```

**❌ What Goes Wrong:**
- Contradictory style requirements
- Conflicting length expectations  
- Impossible audience targeting

**✅ Prevention Strategy:**
```
Write a business proposal with these specific requirements:

Style: Professional but approachable (formal structure, conversational tone)
Length: 2 pages maximum (detailed enough to convince, brief enough to read)
Audience: Technical managers (understand tech concepts, need business justification)

Avoid: Academic jargon, overly casual language, excessive technical detail
```

### 3. Format Failures

**Problem:** Model produces output in wrong format or structure

**❌ Failure-Prone:**
```
Give me the analysis results.
```

**❌ What Goes Wrong:**
- No format specification
- Could be paragraph, bullets, table, etc.
- Hard to use in downstream processes

**✅ Prevention Strategy:**
```
Provide analysis results in this exact format:

## Executive Summary
[2-3 sentence overview]

## Key Findings
1. [Finding 1 with supporting data]
2. [Finding 2 with supporting data]  
3. [Finding 3 with supporting data]

## Recommendations
- **High Priority:** [Action item with timeline]
- **Medium Priority:** [Action item with timeline]
- **Low Priority:** [Action item with timeline]

## Next Steps
[Immediate actions for next 30 days]
```

### 4. Scope Creep

**Problem:** Model provides too much or too little information

**❌ Failure-Prone:**
```
Explain machine learning.
```

**❌ What Goes Wrong:**
- Could be 100 words or 10,000 words
- Might be too basic or too advanced
- No clear boundaries

**✅ Prevention Strategy:**
```
Explain machine learning for a 15-minute presentation to marketing managers:

Scope: Focus only on practical business applications
Depth: Conceptual understanding, no technical implementation
Length: 300-400 words (speaking time ~3 minutes, leaving 12 for Q&A)
Include: 2-3 concrete examples from marketing (recommendation engines, customer segmentation, predictive analytics)
Exclude: Mathematical foundations, programming details, academic research
```

## Self-Correction Prompts

### Built-in Validation

**Pattern 1: Review and Revise**
```
[Your main prompt]

After generating your response, review it against these criteria:
- Does it directly answer the question?
- Is it appropriate for the specified audience?
- Does it meet the length requirements?
- Are examples relevant and clear?

If any criteria aren't met, revise your response.
```

**Pattern 2: Step-by-Step Self-Check**
```
[Your main prompt]

Process:
1. Generate your initial response
2. Check: Does this solve the stated problem?
3. Check: Is the format correct?
4. Check: Is the tone appropriate?
5. If all checks pass, provide the response
6. If any check fails, explain the issue and provide a corrected version
```

### Error Detection Prompts

**Fact-Checking Pattern:**
```
[Your main prompt requiring factual information]

Important: After providing your response, add a "Confidence and Verification" section:
- High confidence facts (you're certain these are correct)
- Medium confidence facts (likely correct but should be verified)
- Low confidence facts (uncertain, definitely need verification)
- Assumptions made (things you assumed to be true)
```

**Logic Validation Pattern:**
```
[Your analytical or reasoning prompt]

After your analysis, include a "Logic Check" section:
- Key assumptions underlying your reasoning
- Potential weaknesses in your analysis
- Alternative interpretations of the data
- What additional information would strengthen the conclusion
```

## Validation and Verification Techniques

### Input Validation

**Before sending your prompt, check:**

```
Prompt Quality Checklist:
□ Task is clearly defined
□ Success criteria are explicit
□ Context is sufficient but not excessive
□ Format requirements are specified
□ Constraints and limitations are clear
□ Examples are provided where helpful
□ Tone and audience are defined
```

### Output Validation

**After receiving a response, evaluate:**

```
Response Quality Checklist:
□ Directly addresses the prompt
□ Meets format requirements
□ Appropriate length and detail level
□ Tone matches requirements
□ Information appears accurate
□ Actionable where required
□ No obvious logical errors
```

### Iterative Refinement Process

**Step 1: Initial Assessment**
```
How well does this response meet my needs?
- What works well?
- What's missing or incorrect?
- What needs clarification?
```

**Step 2: Targeted Improvement**
```
Based on the previous response, please:
- [Fix specific issue 1]
- [Improve specific aspect 2]  
- [Add missing element 3]

Keep the parts that worked well: [list good elements]
```

**Step 3: Final Validation**
```
Please review your revised response to ensure:
- [Original requirement 1] is met
- [Original requirement 2] is met
- [New improvement 1] is incorporated
```

## Common Error Patterns and Solutions

### Pattern 1: Generic Responses

**Symptoms:**
- Response could apply to any similar situation
- Lacks specific details from your prompt
- Uses placeholder language ("your company," "your situation")

**Solutions:**
```
Make your response specific to this situation:
Company: [Your company details]
Industry: [Your industry]
Specific challenge: [Your exact problem]

Use specific names, numbers, and details—avoid generic placeholders.
```

### Pattern 2: Inconsistent Quality

**Symptoms:**
- Some parts are excellent, others are poor
- Tone shifts within the response
- Detail level varies dramatically across sections

**Solutions:**
```
Maintain consistent quality throughout your response:
- Use the same level of detail in each section
- Keep tone consistent (reference: [example of desired tone])
- Each point should have similar depth and supporting evidence
```

### Pattern 3: Context Drift

**Symptoms:**
- Response starts well but goes off-topic
- Important requirements ignored toward the end
- New topics introduced that weren't requested

**Solutions:**
```
Stay focused on the original request throughout your response:

Core task: [Restate main objective]
Key requirements: [List 3-5 must-haves]

Before each paragraph, ask: "Does this directly serve the core task and requirements?"
```

## Robust Prompt Architecture

### The Defense-in-Depth Pattern

**Layer 1: Clear Task Definition**
```
Primary task: [Specific, measurable objective]
```

**Layer 2: Context and Constraints**
```
Context: [Essential background]
Must include: [Non-negotiable requirements]
Must avoid: [Things that would make response unusable]
```

**Layer 3: Quality Assurance**
```
Success looks like: [Concrete description of good output]
Failure looks like: [What to avoid]
```

**Layer 4: Self-Validation**
```
Before responding, verify: [Checklist of key requirements]
```

### Example: Robust Job Description Prompt

```
Primary Task: Write a job description for a Senior Software Engineer position

Context:
- Company: 50-person B2B SaaS startup
- Team: 8 engineers, fully remote
- Tech stack: React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, AWS
- Growth stage: Series A, scaling from 10k to 100k users

Must Include:
- Specific technical requirements (5+ years experience, React expertise)
- Remote work expectations and collaboration tools
- Equity compensation range
- Growth opportunities and career path

Must Avoid:
- Generic corporate language
- Unrealistic skill combinations
- Missing salary/equity information
- Discrimination issues

Success Looks Like:
- Attracts senior-level candidates
- Clear about remote work culture
- Specific enough to filter applicants
- Compelling value proposition

Before Responding, Verify:
□ Technical requirements match our stack
□ Remote work aspects are clear
□ Compensation information included
□ No discriminatory language
□ Tone matches startup culture
```

## Recovery Strategies

### When Prompts Fail

**Immediate Recovery:**
```
That response didn't quite hit the mark. Let me be more specific:

What I need: [Clearer description]
What was missing from the previous response: [Specific gaps]
Corrected requirements: [Revised specifications]
```

**Diagnostic Recovery:**
```
Let me troubleshoot why that didn't work:

Original prompt issues I now see:
- [Issue 1]
- [Issue 2]

Revised prompt with fixes:
[New, improved prompt]
```

### When Context Becomes Corrupted

**Clean Slate Recovery:**
```
Let me start fresh with a cleaner prompt:

[Completely rewritten prompt incorporating lessons learned]

Please ignore the previous exchange and respond only to this new request.
```

## Quick Practice Exercise

Identify the potential failure modes in this prompt and rewrite it to be more robust:

**Original Prompt:**
```
Help me with my presentation.
```

**Your Analysis:**
- Failure Mode 1: ___________
- Failure Mode 2: ___________
- Failure Mode 3: ___________

**Your Robust Version:**
_______________

**Sample Solution:**

**Failure Modes:**
1. Ambiguity: "Help" could mean anything
2. No context: Don't know the presentation topic, audience, or goals
3. No format: Don't know what kind of help is needed

**Robust Version:**
```
Create an outline for a 20-minute presentation about cybersecurity best practices for small business owners.

Context:
- Audience: 30 small business owners (non-technical)
- Setting: Chamber of Commerce monthly meeting
- Goal: Increase awareness and encourage basic security measures

Requirements:
- 3-4 main sections with key points
- Include 1-2 real-world examples per section
- End with specific action items they can implement immediately
- No technical jargon or complex concepts

Format:
**Section 1:** [Topic] (5 minutes)
- Key Point 1
- Key Point 2
- Example: [Brief real-world case]

Success criteria: Audience leaves with clear understanding of what to do next
```
