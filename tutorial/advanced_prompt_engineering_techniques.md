# Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques

This section delves into more sophisticated techniques for optimizing prompts.

## 1. Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Encourage the LLM to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps.  This can improve reasoning and accuracy.

**Example:**

**Prompt:**

"Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does he have now? Let's think step by step."

## 2. Role-Playing

Instruct the LLM to adopt a specific persona or role.  This can influence the style, tone, and content of the output.

**Example:**

**Prompt:**

"You are a seasoned marketing expert.  Write a compelling advertisement for a new electric car."

## 3. Prompt Templates

Create reusable prompt templates for common tasks.  This can save time and ensure consistency.

**Example:**

```
Template:

"Write a [TONE] email to [RECIPIENT] about [TOPIC]."

Usage:

"Write a professional email to my manager about my upcoming vacation."
```

## 4. Meta-Prompting

Use prompts to guide the LLM in generating prompts. This can be useful for exploring different prompting strategies and discovering new approaches.

**Example:**

**Prompt:**

"Suggest three different prompts for generating creative story ideas."

## 5. Negative Constraints

Specify what the LLM *should not* do. This can help to avoid unwanted behaviors or outputs.

**Example:**

**Prompt:**

"Write a summary of this article, but do not include any opinions or personal interpretations."

## 6. Prompt Ensembling

Combine the outputs of multiple prompts to improve robustness and accuracy. This can be done by averaging the results, selecting the best result based on a specific criterion, or using a voting mechanism.
